# deep

Code implementing neural networks at a fairly low level, for the purpose of understanding how they work. 

*network_primitive* implements a basic neural network model. 

*RNN_torch* implements a simple recurrent neural network in PyTorch. It is adapted from the code in Chapter 8 of d2l.ai to allow for the sequential addition of layers like in tf.keras.Sequential.
